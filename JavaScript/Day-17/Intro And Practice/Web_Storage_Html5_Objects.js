//=========             HTML-5 WEB STORAGE OBJECTS              ============

/*
        HTML5 provides 2 - objects for storing data on the client : 

        1.  window.localStorage  : 
                This method stores data with no expiration date.
        2.  window.sessionStorage : 
                This method stores data for one session (Data will be lost
            when the browser tab is closed). Most modern web browsers support
            the web storage, however it is good to check browser support for 
            local and session storage.
